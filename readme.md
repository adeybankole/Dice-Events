# How to Start
1. Clone the project
2. `npm i` - Install all the dependencies
3. There are a lot dependencies that are not updated frequently in parallel with cypress. So while installing if you are seeing conflicts use`npm i --force`.
4. Run `npm test` to execute the tests in Test Runner | Run `npx cypress run` to execute the tests in CLI and 'npx cypress open' to run cypress binary
